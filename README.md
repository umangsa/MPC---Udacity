The Model

As we are interested in the motion of the vehicle, the state represents a dynamic model. The model state has the following parameters:
  * Position Co ordinates - x and y  
  * Orientation of the vehicle - psi
  * Velocity of the vehicle - v
  * Cross track error - cte
  * Orientation error - epsi

The actuator inputs that influence the motion are:
  * Throttle that provides the acceleration - a
  * Steering angle - delta


The equations used to determine how the state changes over time, based on previous state and current actuator inputs are:

      x[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt
      y[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt
      psi[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] / Lf * delta[t] * dt
      v[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt
      cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt
      epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dt

      Lf measures the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity. The larger the vehicle, the slower the turn rate.

Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

    While driving in real life, we keep an eye to the road ahead in the distance. This allows us to anticipate turns, traffic, possible obstacles etc. The look ahead allows us to plan and can influence the speed and smoothness of the drive. This look ahead is modeled as the Horizon in the model.

    The horizon is typically for a few seconds. A longer horizon does not influence too much as the conditions may change by that time. Under certain conditions, a longer horizon is good as it may help to avoid certain emergencies. But for this project, this finer aspect of driving is not useful. Infact, I found that a long horizon causes a lot of problems as you approach the curves. 

    A short horizon causes the car to be very unstable and experiences a lot of oscillations. 

    I started with a small horizon - N = 10 and dt = 0.05. The car would drive at very low speeds and oscillate. It was undrivable at higher speeds

    N = 20, dt = 0.6 was a very long horizon. It worked well for straight roads. But at curves the results were terrible

    I settled  for N = 10 and dt = 0.2 where the horizon is equivalent to 2 sec

Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

    A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. Initially got the car running using 1st order polynomial. As this is a straight line fit, it drives well on straight roads, but jumps around at the curves. To address this, I switched to a 3rd order polynomial. This makes the car turn smoothly

    As part of the preprocessing, I shifted the coordiantes to (0,0) as mentioned in the Q&A video


Model Predictive Control with Latency

    I used the following to introduce latency. I have not understood this part well. It was suggested on the project forum.

          double latency = 0.1;
          px += v * cos(psi) * latency;
          py += v * sin(psi) * latency;
          psi -= v * steer_value / Lf * latency;
          v += throttle_value * latency;

* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * If challenges to installation are encountered (install script fails).  Please review this thread for tips on installing Ipopt.
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/).
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
